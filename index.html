      <p>The Washington Football Team made vast improvements in their 2020 season. Under new head Coach Ron Rivera, the team underwent a massive change to the coaching staff as well as the system they would be playing in. The season started off on a rough footing due to a lack of pre-season/training camp combined with poor Quarterback play from then QB Dwayne Haskins. After benching and eventually releasing Dwayne Haskins the team went on to make their way to the playoffs for the first time in 5 years. The team will look to improve on their accomplishments from this last season to compete at an even higher level in 2021.</p>
